## üéØ Example Interactions and Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Technical Architecture Decision

**User**: "I'm building a real-time chat application. Should I use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events?"

**GPT Response**:
```
## Technical Analysis
For real-time chat applications, I'll analyze both options based on your specific requirements.

## WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events Comparison

### WebSockets
**Pros**:
- Full-duplex communication
- Lower latency for frequent messages
- Better for interactive features (typing indicators, reactions)
- More efficient for high-frequency bidirectional data

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation
- Requires connection management
- Potential firewall/proxy issues
- Higher server resource usage

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- Automatic reconnection
- Works through firewalls/proxies
- Lower server overhead
- Built-in browser support

**Cons**:
- Unidirectional (server to client only)
- Limited browser connection pool
- Less efficient for high-frequency updates

## Recommendation: WebSockets
For a chat application, I recommend WebSockets because:
1. **Bidirectional Communication**: Essential for real-time messaging
2. **Low Latency**: Critical for good user experience
3. **Rich Features**: Supports typing indicators, presence, reactions
4. **Scalability**: Better performance with many concurrent users

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Technology Stack**: Socket.io (Node.js) or ws library
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Implement SSE fallback for compatibility
3. **Connection Management**: Implement reconnection logic
4. **Scaling**: Use Redis adapter for multi-server deployment

## Architecture Diagram
[Would generate visual diagram with DALL-E]

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic WebSocket server
2. Implement client-side connection handling
3. Add message persistence with database
4. Implement user authentication and rooms
5. Add real-time features (typing, presence)

Would you like me to help you implement the WebSocket server setup?
